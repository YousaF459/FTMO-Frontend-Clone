FTMO Frontend Clone Using HTML,CSS & JAVASCRIPT.



I was doing 100daysofcode challenge so after learning HTML,CSS & JAVASCRIPT I Wanted To test out my skills so i start making FTMO Frontend Clone.

I undertook the creation of the FTMO Frontend Clone homepage as a focused project to rigorously test and enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
The primary goal was to replicate the visual and interactive elements of the FTMO homepage, providing a comprehensive showcase of my front-end development capabilities.
